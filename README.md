# Text-Summarizer using NLP



Text summarization is the process of generating short, fluent, and most importantly accurate summary of a respectively longer text document. The main idea behind automatic text summarization is to be able to find a short subset of the most essential information from the entire set and present it in a human-readable format. As online textual data grows, automatic text summarization methods have the potential to be very helpful because more useful information can be read in a short time.
